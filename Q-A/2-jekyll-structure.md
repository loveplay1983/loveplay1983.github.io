A Jekyll website is organized into a specific directory structure that facilitates content management, layout design, and site configuration. Here's an overview of the typical components:

- **`_config.yml`**: This file contains your site's configuration settings, such as site title, author information, and plugin settings. Modifying this file allows you to customize various aspects of your site without altering individual pages.

- **`_posts/`**: This directory holds your blog posts. Each post file must follow the naming convention `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP` (e.g., `2025-01-29-welcome-to-jekyll.md`). Jekyll processes these files and generates the corresponding HTML pages.

- **`_drafts/`**: Unpublished posts reside here. Files in this folder lack a publishing date in their filename. You can preview drafts locally by running `jekyll serve --drafts`.

- **`_layouts/`**: This folder contains templates that define the structure of your pages and posts. For instance, a `post.html` layout might include headers, footers, and content placeholders. Individual posts can specify which layout to use in their front matter.

- **`_includes/`**: Reusable snippets of code, such as headers, footers, or other components, are stored here. You can include these snippets in your layouts or posts using the Liquid tag `{% include file.html %}`.

- **`_data/`**: This directory is for storing YAML, JSON, or CSV files that hold site data. For example, a `members.yml` file could list team members. This data can be accessed in your site's templates via `site.data.members`.

- **`_sass/`**: Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) partials are placed here. These files can be imported into your main stylesheet to modularize and manage your CSS efficiently.

- **`_site/`**: After building your site, Jekyll outputs the generated static files into this directory. It's advisable to add `_site/` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing built files to your repository.

- **`index.html` or `index.md`**: The main landing page of your site. This file can be written in HTML or Markdown and typically includes front matter to specify layout and other settings.

- **`.jekyll-cache/`**: This directory is used by Jekyll to store cache files that speed up the site generation process.
