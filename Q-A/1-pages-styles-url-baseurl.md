Experiencing discrepancies between your local Jekyll site and the live GitHub Pages version, particularly with missing styles, is a common issue. This often stems from incorrect configurations of the `baseurl` and `url` settings in your `_config.yml` file, which affect how asset paths are constructed.

**Understanding `baseurl` and `url`:**

- **`baseurl`**: This setting specifies the subpath of your site when it's published. For a GitHub Pages project site, it should be set to the repository name prefixed with a slash (e.g., `/your-repo-name`).

- **`url`**: This defines the base URL of your site. For GitHub Pages, it's typically `https://your-username.github.io`.

**Common Configuration Scenarios:**

1. **User or Organization Site** (repository named `username.github.io`):
   - Set `baseurl` to an empty string:
     ```yaml
     baseurl: ""
     ```

2. **Project Site** (repository named something other than `username.github.io`):
   - Set `baseurl` to the repository name:
     ```yaml
     baseurl: "/your-repo-name"
     ```

**Adjusting Asset Paths:**

In your HTML files, especially in the `<head>` section where stylesheets are linked, ensure that asset paths incorporate the `baseurl`. This can be achieved by using Jekyll's Liquid templating syntax:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/css/style.css">
```

This approach ensures that the correct path is used both locally and on GitHub Pages.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure that the capitalization of your file and directory names matches exactly, as GitHub Pages is case-sensitive. ([github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/22495?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **File Paths**: Double-check that all asset paths are correct and that the referenced files exist in the specified locations.

- **HTTPS Compliance**: If your site is served over HTTPS, ensure that all assets are also loaded over HTTPS to avoid mixed content issues. ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39481319/jekyll-http-css-not-loading-on-https-site/39481521?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

By carefully configuring your `_config.yml` and adjusting your asset paths accordingly, you can resolve the styling discrepancies between your local Jekyll site and the live GitHub Pages version.
