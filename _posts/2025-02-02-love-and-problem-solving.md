# Peaceful connection between organs

### 1. East and west
There are significant differences between the West and East cultures. As a native Chinese, I am deeply rooted in Eastern culture. However, I once met many American friends and kept communicating with them for approximately 5 years. Therefore, I am more open-minded and care about self-actualization. Because of that, I am still working on PhD at the age of 43. 

### 2. Mr. Jacque Freso and the Venus Project 
I met Mr. Jacque Freso when he was close to the end of his life. His ideas, which I had never thought about, inspired me greatly, and I started to think about things outside my roots. I believe sharing is not naively choosing to give everything out. Instead, the willingness to embrace other nations' concepts, understand, and find ways to work together and make all people the beneficiaries rather than against one another. This is what the Venus project stands for: a world that is not monetary-based but rather resource-based. The reason we must care about sharing and caring for others is simple, if others are suffering, and you are rich, you end up with robbed by others because of the scarcity of resources for others, this is nature of all being. From this point of view, we have no right to blame thieves, who would be willing to risk themselves by theft. Most of the crimes are due to scarcity. 

### 3. Mr. Trump and American-first
Mr. Trump advocates American-first. It is meant to protect and help the US citizen live better and make a stronger American society. However, if we zoom it in and view it from a global view. The mechanism is the same. Think about each nations as the organs within the body of human being, each cell are the individuals. Suppose the heart and brain compete for nutrition without proper management. This body (Earth) will die off in a short period. We will not survive with only one organ. This world runs with diverse organs, and they require a peaceful connection.

### 4. One **Love** to solve them all
Love and friendships are the most substantial ways to solve all our problems. Unless we care about one another with kindness and love, we cannot build a connection to understanding and cooperation. Additionally, it is also a beneficial circle. The more we care about one another, the more good relations we will construct. The better our relations are, the more we care about each other.
