# [pix2tex - LaTeX OCR](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-)

The goal of this project is to create a learning based system that takes an image of a math formula and returns corresponding LaTeX code.

## Using the model

[](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#using-the-model)

To run the model you need Python 3.7+

If you don't have PyTorch installed. Follow their instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Install the package `pix2tex`:

```
pip install "pix2tex[gui]"
```

Model checkpoints will be downloaded automatically.

There are three ways to get a prediction from an image.

1. You can use the command line tool by calling `pix2tex`. Here you can parse already existing images from the disk and images in your clipboard.
2. Thanks to [@katie-lim](https://github.com/katie-lim), you can use a nice user interface as a quick way to get the model prediction. Just call the GUI with `latexocr`. From here you can take a screenshot and the predicted latex code is rendered using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and copied to your clipboard.
   Under linux, it is possible to use the GUI with `gnome-screenshot` (which comes with multiple monitor support). For other Wayland compositers, `grim` and `slurp` will be used for wlroots-based Wayland compositers and `spectacle` for KDE Plasma. Note that `gnome-screenshot` is not compatible with wlroots or Qt based compositers. Since `gnome-screenshot` will be preferred when available, you may have to set the environment variable `SCREENSHOT_TOOL` to `grim` or `spectacle` in these cases (other available values are `gnome-screenshot` and `pil`).
   [![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287601/117812740-77b7b780-b262-11eb-81f6-fc19766ae2ae.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287601/117812740-77b7b780-b262-11eb-81f6-fc19766ae2ae.gif)
   If the model is unsure about the what's in the image it might output a different prediction every time you click "Retry". With the `temperature` parameter you can control this behavior (low temperature will produce the same result).
3. You can use an API. This has additional dependencies. Install via `pip install -U "pix2tex[api]"` and run

   ```shell
   python -m pix2tex.api.run
   ```

   to start a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) demo that connects to the API at port 8502. There is also a docker image available for the API: [https://hub.docker.com/r/lukasblecher/pix2tex](https://hub.docker.com/r/lukasblecher/pix2tex) [![Docker Image Size (latest by date)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0968b558cff9e5cb4d4771312e55793ae3afc3929297491ef2958b0dc2fe5baa/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f646f636b65722f696d6167652d73697a652f6c756b6173626c65636865722f706978327465783f6c6f676f3d646f636b6572)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lukasblecher/pix2tex)

   ```
   docker pull lukasblecher/pix2tex:api
   docker run --rm -p 8502:8502 lukasblecher/pix2tex:api
   ```

   To also run the streamlit demo run

   ```
   docker run --rm -it -p 8501:8501 --entrypoint python lukasblecher/pix2tex:api pix2tex/api/run.py
   ```

   and navigate to [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/)
4. Use from within Python

   ```python
   from PIL import Image
   from pix2tex.cli import LatexOCR

   img = Image.open('path/to/image.png')
   model = LatexOCR()
   print(model(img))
   ```

The model works best with images of smaller resolution. That's why I added a preprocessing step where another neural network predicts the optimal resolution of the input image. This model will automatically resize the custom image to best resemble the training data and thus increase performance of images found in the wild. Still it's not perfect and might not be able to handle huge images optimally, so don't zoom in all the way before taking a picture.

Always double check the result carefully. You can try to redo the prediction with an other resolution if the answer was wrong.

**Want to use the package?**

I'm trying to compile a documentation right now.

## Training the model

[](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#training-the-model-)

Install a couple of dependencies `pip install "pix2tex[train]"`.

1. First we need to combine the images with their ground truth labels. I wrote a dataset class (which needs further improving) that saves the relative paths to the images with the LaTeX code they were rendered with. To generate the dataset pickle file run

```
python -m pix2tex.dataset.dataset --equations path_to_textfile --images path_to_images --out dataset.pkl
```

To use your own tokenizer pass it via `--tokenizer` (See below).

You can find my generated training data on the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13CA4vAmOmD_I_dSbvLp-Lf0s6KiaNfuO) as well (formulae.zip - images, math.txt - labels). Repeat the step for the validation and test data. All use the same label text file.

2. Edit the `data` (and `valdata`) entry in the config file to the newly generated `.pkl` file. Change other hyperparameters if you want to. See `pix2tex/model/settings/config.yaml` for a template.
3. Now for the actual training run

```
python -m pix2tex.train --config path_to_config_file
```

If you want to use your own data you might be interested in creating your own tokenizer with

```
python -m pix2tex.dataset.dataset --equations path_to_textfile --vocab-size 8000 --out tokenizer.json
```

Don't forget to update the path to the tokenizer in the config file and set `num_tokens` to your vocabulary size.

## Model

[](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#model)

The model consist of a ViT [[1](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#References)] encoder with a ResNet backbone and a Transformer [[2](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#References)] decoder.

### Performance

[](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#performance)

| BLEU score | normed edit distance | token accuracy |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| 0.88       | 0.10                 | 0.60           |

## Data

[](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#data)

We need paired data for the network to learn. Luckily there is a lot of LaTeX code on the internet, e.g. [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [arXiv](https://www.arxiv.org/). We also use the formulae from the [im2latex-100k](https://zenodo.org/record/56198#.V2px0jXT6eA) [[3](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#References)] dataset. All of it can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13CA4vAmOmD_I_dSbvLp-Lf0s6KiaNfuO)

### Dataset Requirements

[](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#dataset-requirements)

In order to render the math in many different fonts we use XeLaTeX, generate a PDF and finally convert it to a PNG. For the last step we need to use some third party tools:

* [XeLaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xetex)
* [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) with [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/index.html). (for converting pdf to png)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) (for normalizing Latex code)
* Python 3.7+ & dependencies (specified in `setup.py`)

### Fonts

[](https://github.com/loveplay1983/image-dl-use-fork-from-LaTex-OCR-from-Lukas-blecher-#fonts)

Latin Modern Math, GFSNeohellenicMath.otf, Asana Math, XITS Math, Cambria Math

   sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libjpeg8-dev libopenjp2-7-dev zlib1g-dev \
   libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev python3-tk \
   libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libxcb1-dev
   ```

   These packages provide the necessary headers and libraries for compiling Pillow with support for various image formats and functionalities. citeturn0search2
2. **Reinstall Pillow**:
   After installing the dependencies, reinstall Pillow using pip with the `--no-binary` option to force a source build:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow --no-binary :all:
   ```

   This command compiles Pillow from source, ensuring that it includes support for XCB and other necessary libraries. citeturn0search2

**Alternative Solution: Use Precompiled Binaries**

If you prefer not to compile from source, you can use precompiled Pillow binaries that include XCB support. However, availability may vary depending on your operating system and Python version.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Virtual Environments**:
  If you're using a virtual environment, ensure that it's activated when installing the dependencies and reinstalling Pillow. This ensures that the correct environment is used.
- **System Architecture**:
  Ensure that the libraries and binaries you install are compatible with your system's architecture (e.g., x86_64).
- **Python Version**:
  Verify that the Python version in your virtual environment matches the one used when installing the system packages.

By following these steps, the `OSError` related to missing XCB support in Pillow will be solved.
